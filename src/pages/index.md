## Overview

This documentation helps developers build plugins for Adobe Photoshop versions 22.0 and later. If you're building plugins for earlier versions of Photoshop, see the [CEP Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides).

UXP provides modern JavaScript, a curated selection of UI components, and a more streamlined workflow for plugin developers. With UXP, you can develop:

- Direct Actions - headless plugins that interface with Photoshop, the host OS, and the network, free of any UI.
- Modal Dialogs - plugins that implement one or more modal dialogs. Good for simple user interfaces that don't need to persist.
- Panels - full-featured panels that look like any other panel in Photoshop. UXP panels can contain as complex a UI as you wish to develop. They can be resized, docked, opened and closed just like native Photoshop panels.

**IMPORTANT**:
While this documentation set talks exclusively about Photoshop plugins created using UXP, earlier methods of controlling Photoshop, including CEP (Common Extensibility Platfor) and ExtendScript continue to be supported. You don't need to be in a mad rush to change everything over to UXP, although over time these earlier technologies will be deprecated and then removed from Photoshop.
